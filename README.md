## About

An infinitely large [textboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textboard) model
showcasing a concept for an Internet forum that has the possibility of an
infinite amount of topics at the discretion of visitors. Boards are created
upon their URL being visited, with boards being listed upon a comment being
posted on the board. To conserve storage space, there is a limit on the number
of comments a board can have, with old comments being removed to make room for
new comments.

Currently, no registration is required to comment on the forum. Posts are
stored in SQLite. Each comment is assigned a comment number to uniquely
identify it. A board can be created using the search at the top of the main
page, or by typing a URL in the form of `/b/<board>`. Board names
are case insensitive.

The defaults for the forum can be configured in the file `config.toml` that is
created once the program is run. Config file is read upon the program starting,
so it will have to be restarted if config file changes are made.

### Defaults
- Maximum number of comments per board: `1000`
- Maximum comment length: `2000`
- Post name: `Guest`
- Site name: `Infinity Forums`
- Site description: `Infinity Forums comments section`
- Default board: `general`

## Usage

For simple development.

```
pip3 install flask
flask run
```

When in production, use a WSGI server such as [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
with [Nginx](https://nginx.org/).
